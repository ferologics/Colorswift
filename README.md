Colorswift
==========

My own Xcode colour scheme theme, which I designed for Swift code highlighting. By far the best I've used.

I use it with font named "Source Code Pro" from Adobe that makes it look even better and is one of the best
(if not the best) monospaced fonts for programming out there.

You can get the font here: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

#### To add the theme to your own Xcode use these commands to show all files in terminal 
  
  $ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
  $ killall Finder
  
#### and navigate to directory: ~"your disk"/Users/"your username"/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

It has eye saving colors and perfect contrast, which is great for night and day programming.
